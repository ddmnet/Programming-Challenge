Programming Challenge #2

Problem Description:

	Given a text file, reverse every word in the file.  For instance, the string
	"Hi kids, I'm jack." would become "iH ,sdik m'I .kcaj".  To make life a little
	easier, punctuation at the end of word (comma, period, etc) will be considered part
	of the word.  If I decide to kill the program (ctrl+z, ctrl+d, etc), then file should 
	revert to it's initial state.

Output:
	
	The time in seconds, that it took to run. (ex: 10.01)
	If the program exits via a signal, it should still output the time it took up to that
	point, plus the time it took to revert the file.

Notes:

	- The absolute path to the file will be passed in as the first command line argument
	- The text file may be large, small, or not exist.
	- The file will be a regular text file, UTF-8.

Judging:

	The program will be judged by the following criteria.

	- Correctness
	- Time complexity
	- Space complexity
	- Execution speed
	- Readability / Code Quality
