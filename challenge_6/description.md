## Programming Challenge 6

Given a source of words in the form of a text file, determine the number of dictionary words in the file.  Duplicate words in the source text count towards the final word count.  Your output may be anything that you like, so long as the last two lines of it match the sample output below.

### Sample Input

This is an example test input example test notactuallyaword.

### Sample Output (using /usr/share/dict/words as dictionary source)

Words: 8
Time: 15

### Input File

Located at: http://www.re-cycledair.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/programming_challenge_6_source.txt
Roughly 928k words.

### Dictionary File

Use your Mac's @ /usr/share/dict/words.

### Running your program

Your program should be runnable via the command line.  Example: `python jacks_solution.py [optional args]`.

### Judging

Your program will be judged against the following criteria:

1. Is the solution correct?
2. How long did it take to run?
3. How creative was your solution? (subjective, group vote)

### Rules

You are only allowed to use the same programming lanugage for every third challange.  For instance PHP -> Javascript -> Python -> PHP is OK.  Python -> Ruby -> Python is not.

This is due by 1pm on 3/27.  Please push your submissions into the 'challenge_6' folder in the Programming-Challenge Github repo.
