Challenge #8
============

## Description

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

   3<br />
  7 4 <br />
 2 4 6<br />
8 5 9 3<br />

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle in the file "triangle.txt"

There are ONLY 16384 different routes in the test triangle.

The output should just be the value. Nothing else. 

## Judging

Your program will be judged against the following criteria:

1. Is the solution correct?
2. How long did it take to run?
3. How creative was your solution? (subjective, group vote)

** Timing will be determined by "time [your executable]"

### Rules

You are only allowed to use the same programming language for every third challenge.  For instance PHP -> Javascript -> Python -> PHP is OK.  Python -> Ruby -> Python is not.

This is due by the end of the day on 5/8. Please push your submissions into the 'challenge_8' folder in the Programming-Challenge Github repo.
