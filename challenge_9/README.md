Challenge #9
============

## Description

** Do it in a language you've never used before!

Implement a Vigenère Cipher, a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution[1], to encrypt a simple alphabetic message.

Your program should take two arguments:
	
	1. a key
	2. a plaintext message to encrypt

Your program should output valid Vigenère Cipher text.

* Spaces remain unecrypted spaces in this version of the cipher.

## Judging

Your program will be judged against the following criteria:

	1. Is the solution correct?
	2. Phase of the moon in relation to your birthdate.
	3. Random lottery


### Rules

You are only allowed to use the same programming language for every third challenge.  For instance PHP -> Javascript -> Python -> PHP is OK.  Python -> Ruby -> Python is not.

This is due by the end of the day on 6/26. Please push your submissions into the 'challenge_9' folder in the Programming-Challenge Github repo.
