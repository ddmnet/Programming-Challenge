Challenge #9
============

## Description

** Do it in a language you've never used before! Or not, it's up to you.

Implement a Vigenère Cipher, a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution[1], to encrypt a simple alphabetic message.

Your program should take two arguments:
	
	1. a key
	2. a plaintext message to encrypt

Your program should output valid Vigenère Cipher text.

* Spaces remain unecrypted spaces in this version of the cipher.
