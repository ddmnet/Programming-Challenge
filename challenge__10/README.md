Challenge #10
============

## Description

** Do it in a language you've never used before! Or not, it's up to you.

Write a program that prints out the Sierpinski Triangle as ASCII art.

Your program should take one arguments:
	
	1. The number of triangle iterations

So, for example: 

Input: 2
Output:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/__\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;/\  /\<br />
&nbsp;/__\/__\<br />

Input: 3
Output:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/__\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\  /\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/__\/__\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\      /\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;/__\    /__\<br />
&nbsp;/\  /\  /\  /\<br />
/__\/__\/__\/__\<br />


And, so on...

But keep in mind, your triangles do not need this exact structure. Have some fun with it. Creativitiy is not your enemy.

## Judging

Your program will be judged against the following criteria:

	1. Does your triangle have Sierpenski Triangle form?
	2. Number of characters of code

### Rules

This is due by the end of the day on 7/10. Please push your submissions into the 'challenge__10' folder in the Programming-Challenge Github repo.
